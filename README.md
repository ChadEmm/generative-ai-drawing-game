This ia quick game I made with pygame (python) and a touchscreen connected to a raspberry pi.  The idea is that you use generative AI to create a drawing prompt, the user draws the image on the touchscreen, and then we in turn use generative AI to make whatever they drew look pretty.

I got it functional, but didn't take it much further than that (as I had to return the hardware I was using).  I hoped to add a color picker to the game to increase the variability of the images that were generated.
